# Time-Series-prediction-of-rainfall
-The time series prediction of rainfall was done using SVM and MLP; conventional models based on various climatic features were also constructed using SVM and MLP.
-Among these four models the conventional model constructed using SVM appears to be the best solution with a mean absolute error of 13.66; the project was implemented using MATLAB and LIBSVM.
-All the files required to run the code have been uploaded here alongwith the dataset used; the project report includes the results and the methods employed to arrive at the results.
-Most of the files included here are necessary to run the LIBSVM but program files written for the project are marked with an asterisk. These files are included in libsvm-3.21/matlab.
